          JeongYoon Choi was born in Seoul, South Korea. Driven by and having
          been exposed to constant challenge from peers and at home, she
          learned not only to adapt, but also to thrive academically and stay

          Institute of Science & Technology) with a Master’s in Engineering.
          Afterwards she worked as a consultant at Accenture and a
          strategic manager at Kakao Corp, overseeing several major acquisitions.
